To build the implementation:
1.Run 'make' in assign1 directory

To clean the bin folder:
1.Run 'make clean' in assign1 directory

To test the lexer:
1. Run 'bin/lexer test/test1.cs' in assign1 directory.

[NOTE: Source of implementation is in 'src' directory which is a 'lexer.l' (a lex file). Running 'make' generated 'lexer' executable and 'lex.yy.c' which is removed after compilation]
